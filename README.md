My Learnings:

Engaging in the research paper titled "Disruption Risk Mitigation in Supply Chains" within KPMG's Digital Lighthouse department has not only provided me with valuable insights into the field of operational research but also allowed me to acquire a profound understanding of its applications. This project served as a platform for me to delve deeper into the domain of operational research, enhancing my knowledge and refining my skills in this discipline.

One of the most significant learning experiences stemmed from delving into Probability and Statistics. Through the project, I gained a comprehensive understanding of the approaches required to decipher complex mathematical models, equations, parameters, denominations, and variables. Concepts such as dual variables, stochastic programming, and Linear Programming further enriched my knowledge base, equipping me with a more sophisticated understanding of these fundamental principles.

In addition to operational research, the project exposed me to the utilization of AnyLogic, a simulation software. By designing and implementing a simulation model using AnyLogic, I not only grasped the operational intricacies of the software but also acquired a versatile skill set that can be applied to a wide array of real-world scenarios. Moreover, I expanded my knowledge of Python by exploring the PuLP library and gained hands-on experience with Pandas, enhancing my proficiency in data science and data analysis techniques.

Throughout this internship, I embraced numerous challenges and harnessed the support and guidance of my mentor and colleagues. This collaborative environment fostered personal growth and facilitated the development of problem-solving skills. It allowed me to adapt swiftly to novel situations, nurtured my resilience, and honed my ability to approach complex problems with confidence and creativity.

In conclusion, this project has been an extraordinary learning experience, exposing me to the realm of operational research and providing me with invaluable insights. I have acquired a deep understanding of the domain, enhancing my skills in Probability and Statistics, and gaining proficiency in operational research techniques such as dual variables, stochastic programming, and Linear Programming. Furthermore, the opportunity to work with AnyLogic, PuLP library, and Pandas has expanded my knowledge of Python and fortified my expertise in data science. I am grateful to KPMG and my mentor for providing me with this enriching opportunity, which has undoubtedly propelled my professional growth and equipped me with a valuable skill set for future endeavors in the corporate world.
